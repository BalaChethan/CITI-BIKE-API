# CITI-BIKE-API
Real-time Data Extraction and Transformation from Citi Bike API	
•	Conceptualized and developed a dynamic ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline in Python, utilizing Requests and Pandas libraries, to extract, transform, and load real-time bike-sharing data from Citi Bike’s API in GBFS format into a PostgreSQL database.
•	Demonstrated mastery in data manipulation and transformation by utilizing the Requests library to efficiently retrieve data from the REST API and then converting and structuring it into Pandas dataframes.
•	Applied advanced data transformation techniques to parse and structure station information feed from the Citi Bike API, which provided data about bike-sharing stations in New York City.
•	Validated the data transformation process by conducting thorough queries on the resulting PostgreSQL tables, ensuring accuracy and completeness of data.
•	Achieved project objectives by delivering a highly efficient and accurate ELT pipeline, which effectively translated real-time data into actionable insights.
•	Showcased exceptional problem-solving and technical skills by overcoming challenges inherent to real-time data extraction and transformation.
•	Maintained comprehensive documentation of the data migration process, including code snippets and data validation results, facilitating knowledge sharing and supporting future data initiatives.
•	Tools Utilized: Python, Pandas, Requests, PostgreSQL, Citi Bike API, GBFS format.
